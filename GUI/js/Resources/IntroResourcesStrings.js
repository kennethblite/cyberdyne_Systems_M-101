I mean you guys were out here, doing stuff and I had to wait to get picked and didn't get to have fun with you.  I found some other emoticons who were bored like me, we formed a secret club, called ourselves Chatmen and escaped from the virtual world!  It was pretty hairy - someday I'll tell you about it.  Good news is I'm here now.  So let's go chat, man!",

    Scene5Personality2: "Wow. Hi! Ginger here. This is gonna be super cool. We're gonna hang out, blab, all that stuff. Mmm, things you should know about me. Besides being totally jazzed about IM, chatting, you know all that communications and gossipy stuff, I'm into music, movies and nature.  I like to read sometimes.  And I have been known to dabble in sports.  I mean, I play soccer, snowboard and rollerblade.  Mostly.  Oh.  And I'm totally into saving the planet.  Yeah.  That's me in a nutshell. ",
